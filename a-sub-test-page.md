# Content

The content being on the right hand side of the edit page is a bit confusing, but I guess once you know it is clean and easy to use.

It's interesting that it shows the content in markdown.

> It works well

1. And lists seem to be ok
2. This reminds me a lot of Bear App

So[ links](goggle.com "Link")?

Code snippets too, I don't think we'll define them.

Also you save as a draft, preview if you wish, then turn draft off, click save and it goes to the real site.
