## Our mission

Our mission is to create semantic, social, and responsive websites with exceptional user experience. 

## What we do

We began in 2010, calling ourselves a web agency who built Drupal sites, but these days we're so much more. 

Code Enigma offers a full project lifecycle of services, from design, website development, support and maintenance and a full suite of hosting solutions.

 Independent companies, STEAM organisations, public sector, educational institutions, charities and not-for-profit groups (to name some) have benefited from working with us.

## What we’re trying to achieve

### **5 year picture**

You can be directed to the Values and Mid Term Picture document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hsGSxJx6ahDotCKxH1bhjaA1ZHuoK7vWOuuBtCOXv-E), where you’ll find more detail about where we’re headed as a company over the next 5 years.

Shorter term goals will be communicated through Redmine and announcements in the team meeting.
